# odin-recipes
First odin project creating a website for recipes. 

I created a website for 3 different different recipes using basic html. I first started off by creating an index.html file for the homepage. This file along with the other recipes files started off with an html boilerplate. Then I added images, titles, paragraphs, lists, and links to complete each page. Each page has an easy to follow recipe ending with a link back to the homepage. All the recipes are displayed on the home page using a unordered list of the links to the other recipes.
